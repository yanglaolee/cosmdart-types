# cosmdart-types

Inspired by [cosmjs-types](https://github.com/confio/cosmjs-types/).

This project aims to promote the development of the Cosmos tech stack on mobile, and you are free to use this library in your Flutter/Dart code.

## Build
Make sure you have installed [Buf CLI](https://buf.build/docs/installation) and other [Dart prerequisites](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/dart/quickstart/).

```bash
> cd protos

# Modify the `buf.gen.yaml` file to the version you want

> buf generate
```
